## Overview
This course is divided into three modules, if you have good experience with Python you can start from the second module.
### Python
This module is about general Python coding, for example variables, basic and advanced data structures, control structures, and functions.  This will get you up to a level good enough to do most tasks in Python.
### Data analysis
This module introduces you to the backbone packages of Python for doing almost any (data) analysis, from numerical computing with NumPy, data wrangling with Pandas, to data visualisation with MatPlotLib.
### Data engineering
This module teaches you how to connect to and manage SQL databases in general, it also covers specifically SQL Server and SQLite.
